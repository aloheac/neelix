# neelix
An object-oriented implementation of hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (HMC) and complex Langevin (CL) for computing the equation of state of nonrelativistic fermions in one dimension. This modular implementation is written such that new field evolution techniques can be written quickly and independently of the implementation of the auxiliary field. This package is used to generate a database of field configurations which are used to train convolutional neural networks which identify the most important contributions to the grand-canonical partition function.
